# Mysterious-Organism-Project

This project uses a JavaScript factory function to create extremely simplified DNA strands for an imaginary creature and create an array of specimen subjects.

# Installation and Tests

To install, use, and test the functions:

* Download the folders and files onto your computer. 
* Uncomment the function calls at the bottom of the file and/or the console.logs in the functions themselves
